# üêß Installing Fedora 36 on Surface Pro 6 ‚Äì Complete Guide

## üåü Why Fedora 36 is the Best Baseline

Fedora 36 strikes the perfect balance for Surface Pro 6 users:

- ‚úÖ **Excellent Hardware Compatibility:** Touchscreen, pen, sensors, and auto-rotation work better than in later Fedora releases.
- ‚úÖ **Wayland and X11 Support:** Choose the best session for your needs ‚Äî X11 is recommended if multitouch or screen rotation is buggy on Wayland.
- ‚úÖ **Upgradable:** Once Fedora 36 is installed and working well, you can choose to upgrade to a newer Fedora version.
- ‚úÖ **Surface Kernel Support:** The `linux-surface` team provides a compatible kernel with better support for Surface devices.

This guide was tested out on Surface Pro 6 but would likely also work with other Surface Pro generations like Surface Pro 5.
