# The very inofficial MacOS Virtual Machine on Ubuntu (Unofficial Hackintosh VM Guide)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**: This guide is for educational purposes only. Running macOS on non-Apple hardware violates Apple's End User License Agreement (EULA). Proceed at your own risk. This method is not officially supported by Apple, and may stop working at any time due to software updates or changes in macOS validation mechanisms.

## Introduction
This guide shows how to run macOS as a virtual machine on Ubuntu using QEMU and KVM. It avoids the need for dual booting or installing macOS directly on your hardware (which is far riskier). The macOS VM will run via virtualization with OpenCore bootloader support to bypass Apple's hardware checks.

Tested on: **Ubuntu 22.04+** with **Intel CPU** supporting VT-x/VT-d.

---

## Step 1: Install Required Packages
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system virt-manager bridge-utils git python3
```

Add your user to the required groups:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
```
Then log out and back in (or reboot).

Check if your CPU supports virtualization:
```bash
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```
If the result is greater than 0, you're good to go.

---

## Step 2: Clone the OSX-KVM Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM.git
cd OSX-KVM
```
This repository provides the base configuration and scripts for running macOS via QEMU.

---

## Step 3: Download macOS Installer
Run the fetch script to download a version of macOS (Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, etc.):
```bash
./fetch-macOS.py
```
Choose your desired version when prompted. This uses Apple's official software catalog.

---

## Step 4: Create the Installation ISO
Use the provided script to convert the installer to a bootable ISO:
```bash
./make.sh --iso
```
This will generate something like `macOS-Catalina.iso` or similar.

---

## Step 5: Configure and Launch the VM
You can use the sample launch scripts, like `OpenCore-Boot.sh` or `basic.sh`. Customize CPU, RAM, and disk paths:

Edit `OpenCore-Boot.sh` as needed:
```bash
# Example edits in the script
-cpu host
-smp 4,cores=2
-m 8192
-drive file=macOS.qcow2,format=qcow2
```
Then launch the VM:
```bash
./OpenCore-Boot.sh
```
You‚Äôll boot into the OpenCore interface, then choose the macOS installer.

---

## Step 6: Install macOS in the VM
Once in the installer:
1. Open Disk Utility.
2. Erase the virtual disk (e.g., `macOS.qcow2`) and format it as **APFS**.
3. Proceed with the installation.

The VM will reboot several times during install ‚Äî just wait it out and keep selecting the installer until it boots into macOS.

---

## Step 7: Post-Install Notes
- You may need to reconfigure OpenCore to boot from your installed system.
- Consider creating a snapshot of your VM after a successful install.
- For better performance, consider enabling VirtIO GPU, CPU passthrough, or using SPICE.

## Running the macOS VM from a USB 3.2 Stick

Running the VM from a fast USB stick (like a Samsung USB 3.2 bar) is possible and convenient ‚Äî great for portability!

### **Preparation:**
1. Format the USB stick as **ext4** using GParted or `mkfs.ext4`.
2. Mount it somewhere persistent, e.g.:
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/macusb
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/macusb
```
Replace `/dev/sdX1` with your actual device.

### **Move the VM Directory:**
```bash
mv ~/OSX-KVM /mnt/macusb/OSX-KVM
cd /mnt/macusb/OSX-KVM
```

### **Update Scripts:**
Edit the `OpenCore-Boot.sh` (and similar launchers) to point to the new paths:
```bash
-drive file=/mnt/macusb/OSX-KVM/macOS.qcow2,format=qcow2
```

### **Make It Portable:**
- Add a `.desktop` launcher or shell script to quickly mount and launch.
- Consider setting the USB mount as permanent by editing `/etc/fstab`.

### **Performance Tip:**
Make sure the stick is connected to a **USB 3.0/3.2 port**, not USB 2.0. Also, avoid NTFS or FAT32 ‚Äî use native Linux file systems like `ext4` or `btrfs` for full performance.

---

## Known Limitations
- No support for Apple-exclusive services like iMessage, FaceTime, AirDrop.
- Touchscreen, pen, and some sensors will **not** work.
- Graphics acceleration is limited (no Metal support).
- You may experience instability with macOS updates.

---

## Optional Enhancements
- Add shared folders using 9p or Samba.
- Use virt-manager for GUI-based VM management.
- Add QEMU Guest Agent for shutdown support and clipboard sharing.

---

## Final Thoughts
Running macOS in a VM is a great way to test or develop for Apple platforms on non-Apple hardware. It‚Äôs more stable than dual-boot Hackintosh setups and doesn‚Äôt risk your native OS install. Just remember:

- This is **not supported or endorsed by Apple**.
- Expect bugs and breakages with updates.
- Back up your VM image regularly.
